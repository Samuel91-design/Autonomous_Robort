# Autonomous Mobile Robot 
### (In partial fulfilment of Advanced Engineering Course, MECH617, Asgesi-ETH MSc)
The goal of this project is to design a robot that can cross a trench that is 200mm. The robot's dimensions at the start should fit a 200mm cube. The robot starts at a position parallel to the trench and should be capable of doing a 90-degree turn before advancing towards crossing the trench.
